== Cacique, Do it once

Cacique was born with the need of MercadoLibre to expedite the testing process for 
your application. Based in Selenium to record the tests script, Cacique manage all 
cases, Data Set, Suites executions and Script editing.

* Easy to automate testing without knowing about develop language
* Ability to develop and maintain tests (scripts).
* Run tests on different platforms with different input data and external to the script
* Configurable for different work environments
* Easy to concatenate multiple scripts.


“Do it Once” speaks of re-using tests. Our main objective was to
create a collaborative tool with a library of scripts and suites to
share with other users.
